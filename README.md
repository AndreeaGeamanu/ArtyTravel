# ArtyTravel

Our app, ArtyTravel combines the travelling idea with the one of music and art by offering some packages that include accomodation, transportation and tickets
to the specified event. The packages are both predefined and personalizable, so that people can enjoy concerts, festivals, art and the culture 
of that country.

As a client, when I enter the web app, I can see the packages offered by the company or I can create my own choosing some of the available options for what I am interested in.
I can use the filter for the packages to select the confort (hostel, 5 star hotel), destination, event kind, duration of my trip.

After adding them into the cart, I can buy them and see all my past journeys/purchases on the user page, under my profile.
What I find interesting, is that if I want so, I can find a trip partner.
